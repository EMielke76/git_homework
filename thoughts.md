Takeaways
1. Turing is going to require a massive commitment, but with good time-management and a mindset that says "You don't know this YET, but you WILL", I'll come out on the other side ready to join and make an impact on any team that will have me.

2. Open communication with my cohort is going to be essential to ALL of our success. This isn't a competition, it's a collaborative experience. Lean into that. Build on that. Build one another up.

Commitments Moving Forward
1. Setting a  20min timer on my Google searching so I do not fall down a search rabbit hole, blink, and find 2hrs of my day gone.
2. Using that same timer to keep track of the time I spend trouble-shooting a problem. 20min chunks before either walking away from the problem for 5min, or asking for help, depending on whether or not I felt like I was making any progress on the issue at hand.
